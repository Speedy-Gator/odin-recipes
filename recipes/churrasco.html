    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> This is a popular go to recipe in South American countries. Perfect for a family or group event. We get the smoky fatty steak from the cut, while the chimichurri brings the salty and acid for a perfect combination of flavors!
        </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>1.5 cups of mojo criollo</li>
                <li>2 lbs of skirt steak</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>Chimichurri sauce</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Marinate the skirt steak in a plastic zip top or large mixing bowl with the mojo criollo marinade for at least 30 minutes and up to 3 hours in the fridge. This step is optional, but it does impart tenderness to the skirt steak.</li>
                <li>Take the bag out of the fridge 45 minutes before cooking to rest. Before cooking, pat the skirt steak dry and season evenly with the kosher salt and ground pepper.</li>
                <li>If using a grill, make sure the charcoal coals are white and hot. Grill 3-4 minutes on each side for medium-rare. On a grill pan on the stove, use high heat. Sear the skirt steak on each side for 3 minutes for medium-rare.</li>
                <li>Let the steak rest on a cutting board or plate, covered with aluminum foil, for at least 5 minutes before cutting.</li>
                <li>Serve thinly sliced against the grain, topped with chimichurri sauce.</li>
            </ol>
